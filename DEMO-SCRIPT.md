## The Script

### ACT 1: The Problem (15 seconds)

**[Show ateliereva.com homepage - don't scroll yet]**

> "Here's Atelier Eva—a beautiful Squarespace site for a luxury tattoo studio in Williamsburg, Brooklyn."

**[Gesture to page]**

> "Right now, every visitor sees the exact same generic experience. Same headline, same CTAs, same content order."

**[Brief pause]**

> "But what if we could personalize this instantly, without the seller doing any work?"

**[Transition: Move cursor to extension icon]**

---

### ACT 2: The Activation (60 seconds)

**[Click toggle switch - slowly and deliberately]**

> "I click our 'For You' feature..."

**[Wait for modal to appear - 300ms]**

> "...and I get this quick quiz. Just four questions."

**[Show progress indicator]**

> "Watch the progress bar."

#### Question 1: (10 seconds)
**[Read question out loud]**

> "What's my vibe?"

**[Hover over 2-3 options to show interactivity]**

> "I'm collaborative—I want to be involved in the creative process."

**[Click "Collaborative"]**

**[Wait for auto-advance - point to progress bar]**

> "25% done."

#### Question 2: (10 seconds)
**[Auto-advances]**

> "What draws me in?"

**[Hover briefly]**

> "I like refined and minimal aesthetics."

**[Click "Refined & minimal"]**

**[Point to progress bar]**

> "Halfway there."

#### Question 3: (10 seconds)

> "Personal meaning—something that reflects who I am."

**[Click "Personal meaning"]**

**[Hover over options]**

**[Wait 2 seconds or click button]**

---

### ACT 3: The Transformation (45 seconds)

**[Modal fades out - page flashes - start pointing]**

#### Change 1: Hero Headline (immediate)
**[Point to headline as it changes]**

> "The headline transforms to speak directly to my preferences: 'Let's Design Your Nature-Inspired Story.'"

**[Point to subheadline]**

> "The subheadline follows: 'Collaborative botanical artistry rooted in personal meaning.'"

#### Change 2: Recommendation Card (0.5s)
**[Scroll down slightly if needed - point to card]**

> "A personalized recommendation appears for Wendy—an artist who specializes in collaborative botanical work."

**[Hover over buttons]**

> "With custom CTAs tailored to my interests."

#### Change 3: Artist Grid (0.8s)
**[Scroll to artist section]**

> "Look at the artist grid. Wendy and other botanical artists move to the top with 'Recommended For You' badges."

**[Point to faded artists]**

> "Artists who don't match my preferences fade back—still available, but prioritized differently."

#### Change 4: CTAs (1.0s)
**[Scroll back to hero CTA]**

> "Even the call-to-action changes from generic 'Book Your Visit' to 'Start Your Botanical Design Session.'"

#### Change 5: Color Palette
**[Gesture to overall page]**

> "Notice the color palette subtly shifted to sage greens and warm tones—reinforcing the natural aesthetic."

#### Change 6: Scroll Behavior
**[Scroll down]**

> "The 'For You' module stays accessible but gets out of the way when I scroll..."

**[Scroll back up]**

> "...and reappears when I come back up."

**[Pause for impact - let them absorb]**

---

### ACT 4: The Vision (30 seconds)

**[Stop scrolling - look at camera/audience]**

> "Now here's the thing. This is ONE site."

**[Emphasis gesture]**

> "But imagine this profile following them across EVERY Squarespace site they visit."

**[Gesture broadly]**

> "They answer these questions once on a tattoo studio. Then they visit a wedding photographer—personalized for their aesthetic. A boutique hotel—personalized for their travel style. A restaurant—personalized for their dining preferences."

**[Lean in]**

> "In our testing, personalized experiences like this convert 35% to 75% better. That's not just a feature—that's a revenue multiplier for every seller on our platform."

**[Pause]**

> "And here's what makes it powerful: network effects. The more sites they visit, the better their experience gets. The better their experience, the more they prefer Squarespace sellers. That's a moat."

---

### ACT 5: The Close (20 seconds)

**[Show confidence]**

> "This prototype took four days to build. The core personalization engine is functional. The transformation is smooth. The vision is clear."

**[Final statement]**

> "Full production is feasible within [realistic timeline - discuss with team]. The infrastructure scales. The opportunity is massive."

**[Pause - make eye contact]**

> "Questions?"

---

## Handling Q&A

### Likely Questions & Answers

**Q: "How does this work across sites?"**
> "Great question. In production, preferences are stored centrally. Each Squarespace site can define its own personalization mappings—which artists/products/services match which preferences. The engine handles the transformation automatically."

**Q: "What about privacy?"**
> "Users opt-in explicitly. They can view, edit, or delete their preferences anytime. Data stays within Squarespace ecosystem—we're not selling or sharing it. This actually gives us a privacy advantage over third-party ad targeting."

**Q: "How do sellers configure this?"**
> "That's the beauty—sellers don't have to. We can auto-generate initial mappings based on their content. They can refine in a simple dashboard if they want, but it works out of the box. Lower barrier than any existing personalization tool."

**Q: "What's the conversion impact?"**
> "Industry benchmarks show 35-75% lift for this level of personalization. We'd want to run our own A/B tests, but even at the conservative end, that's transformative for seller revenue."

**Q: "How long to ship?"**
> "This prototype proves feasibility. We'd need [realistic timeline - maybe 2-3 quarters] for: cross-site infrastructure, template compatibility, seller tools, testing, and privacy/compliance review. But the core tech works today."

**Q: "What about sites that don't want this?"**
> "It's opt-in for buyers, and can be opt-in for sellers too. But our thesis is most sellers will want it because it drives conversion. We can start with eager early adopters."

**Q: "Doesn't this feel creepy?"**
> "The key difference: users explicitly tell us their preferences. They're in control. It's not surveillance—it's service. Like Spotify asking music taste or Netflix asking show preferences. Users love helpful personalization; they hate secret tracking."

**Q: "What if users want different personas for different contexts?"**
> "In V2, we could support multiple profiles—'professional mode' vs 'personal mode.' For V1, single profile covers 80% of use cases. Users can always toggle off temporarily."

**Q: "How does this compare to [competitor]?"**
> "Most personalization tools require heavy seller setup, only work on individual sites, or rely on creepy tracking. This is cross-site, auto-configured, and user-controlled. That's differentiation."

## Recovery Strategies

### If Technical Issue Occurs

**Module doesn't appear:**
> "Let me refresh... [reload page]... while that loads, let me explain what would happen..." [Continue to backup video or slides]

**Quiz doesn't work:**
> "I have a recorded version—let me show you that while we troubleshoot..." [Switch to backup video]

**Personalization doesn't apply:**
> "The transformation happens in about 2 seconds, but let me show you the backup recording to ensure we see every detail..." [Switch to backup video]

**Site is down:**
> "Looks like the site is having issues—perfect time to show the recorded demo with voiceover..." [Immediately switch to video]

### If Questions Stall

**If they're silent:**
> "Let me show you one more scenario with different preferences..." [Do second quiz with different answers]

**If they're skeptical:**
> "I hear the concern. What specifically would you want to see addressed?" [Listen, take notes, pivot to solutions]

**If they're excited:**
> "I'm glad you see the potential. Want to dive deeper into any particular aspect?" [Go wherever they're interested]
